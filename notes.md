when social_network_structure == 1,
all agents' personality is chatty,so among three type messages,
RED  is the most popular message type agents broadcast
with percent 50%.RED and GREED are forwarding by agents
with percent 50% while BLUE is maybe not forwarding mostly.All
regions of the network work samely.


when social_network_structure == 2,
the gossip message is most prevalent and business message is
the last  agents choose.Besides,agents talk not much often with
specified message.All regions of the network work samely.


when social_network_structure == 3,
it's not obvious which type message is the most popular.
we can see that agent send message to its friends
is random.we can see that agents with
id 0,2,4 are broadcasting often while the others keep silent more.


when social_network_structure == 4,
the agents with id 0,1,2 broadcast message usually while the others don't emit meaasge much.
Futhermore,BLUE and RED are more prevalent than GREDD being broadcast.


when social_network_structure == 5,
the agents of 20 are only forwarding and broadcasting,
not specially send a message to some certin friends.
It's more complex than above,a agent may have two more friends.
Agent's personality is randomly assigned,therefore,
it's hard to say what characteristic the network has for status varies from time to time.
